Designer by training, entrepreneur by choice, and a relentless explorer at heart. I juggle my passions for technology, music, and endless learning to bring a unique twist to everything I do. In a nutshell, I'm here to blend creativity with purpose, and have a blast while doing it.

#builttobuild, I've co-founded 2 companies so far and been involved in several other projects. Nothing major, but here is my list:

2023 - DAAS & Creative Hub Blureo - tech oriented creative place

Suite for Creatives Zunego - simple apps for client management

2023 - Rebranding my country for accesibility Remania (kinda ongoing) - a passion for this nation

2022 - My first design agency Takameru (merger) - focused on storytelling and minimalism

2022 - A MVP, I've really enjoyed Grafoteca (now CumStam.ro) - visual maps for Statistics
